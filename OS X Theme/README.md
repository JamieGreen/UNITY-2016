OS X El Capitan Theme

This theme works with El Capitan 10.11.2.

To replace and then use the theme files you need to disable SIP for El Capitan.

Next you copy the included .CAR files(6 files) to the destination on your startup disk.
Path to replace the files is here: /System/Library/CoreServices/SystemAppearance.bundle/Contents/Resources/

Use the Go To function in the Finder to quickly go there - Please make a backup of the files there before inserting mine.
